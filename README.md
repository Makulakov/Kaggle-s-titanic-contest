# Titanic: Machine Learning from Disaster

My implementation for the classic [Titanic Kaggle competition](https://www.kaggle.com/competitions/titanic/). This project explores various machine learning models to predict passenger survival on the Titanic.

## Project Structure

- **Titanic_DRAFT.ipynb**: Exploratory data analysis, model experimentation, and development process with notes
- **RESULT.ipynb**: Final organized implementation with optimized models, transformers, and best parameters

## Models Explored

During this project, I tested and compared several classical machine learning models including:
- Random Forest
- Logistic Regression  
- Support Vector Machines
- Gradient Boosting
- Elastic Net
  
## Results

- Created ensamble of models:
  1. Predicting age of a passanger
  2. Predicting survival 
- Best accuracy: 0.77751
